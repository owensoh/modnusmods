# ModNUSMods

## Proposed Level of Achievement
Apollo 11

# Motivation
When it comes to planning their timetable for the next semester, most students would turn to NUSMods to help them do so. As convenient of a platform as NUSMods is, there are improvements that can be made.

Timetable planning has always been a hassle. It takes so much time to manually add every mod you want to take, scour through the endless list of tutorial slots to find one that fits, only to see that it clashes with this one hour lecture from this one random mod that you have to take this sem because it is not available at any other sem.
Furthermore with the constraint of Covid-19 restrictions, you don’t know whether the mod you want to take offers physical classes or not.

## Aim
We hope to improve the timetable planning process, by making the planning of timetable automated, while catering as much as possible to the user’s needs.
